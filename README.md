	i need to validate the host/port duplicates btwn servers

	if the config file is like : listen 80; the host is by default 0.0.0.0 !!

	also need to seperate with the newlines and not ignore them

	don't forget to handle comments

	server_name can have any value, for example 127.0.0.1:8080 or localhost:8080

	redirect should be renamed to return (or ret lamakhlawkch dir return) and the second value can be empty
